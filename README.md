_adjective: lacking spirit or liveliness._

**Lackadaisical** is a Python package for keeping an eye on slow code.

## Usage

To assert that a block of code should execute and return within a number of seconds, use `lackadaisical.assert_faster_than` as either a decorator or a context manager.

For example, `assert_faster_than` will raise `lackadaisical.TooSlow` if this test doesn't finish within 30 seconds of starting:

```python
from lackadaisical import assert_faster_than

@assert_faster_than(30)
def test_my_slow_function() -> None:
    my_slow_function()
```

In this example, the test's setup is free to take as long as it needs and only the slow function is monitored:

```python
from lackadaisical import assert_faster_than

def test_my_slow_function() -> None:
    data = my_slow_preparation()

    with assert_faster_than(30):
        my_slow_function(data)
```

`assert_faster_than` will not interrupt your code's execution after its time has elapsed, but `lackadaisical.TooSlow` will report the difference between the actual and expected execution times to help you diagnose the problem.

```text
Operation took 2.6 seconds (expected 2.0 at most)
```

## Installation

Lackadaisical requires Python 3.9 or later and can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/lackadaisical/).

```shell
pip install lackadaisical
```
